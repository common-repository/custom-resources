Easily load additional styles and scripts (for both front and backend pages).
Works by direct inline embedding or by using URL's.

== Description ==

This plugin will make developers and site builders (hopefully very) happy.

It enables site administrators to supply additional styles or/and scripts to
be loaded alongside the theme's resources. It will work regardless which
theme the site is running, which makes it brilliant for adding custom
programming and content blocks.

Styles and scripts can be either entered manually or loaded from 
external URL's.
